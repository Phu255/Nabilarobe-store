*** What I have learned (done) :

- Connect all pages with path 

- Make basic Front End all pages 

- Create a cart for use to buy product

- Used Devise Gem ,Font Awesomes Icons from Yarn (Using Package Manager and import "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free/css/all")

- Upload Image by using Active Storage

- Make products in line with CSS grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill)

- Upload file to Github for saving

- Carousel with Rails by Flickity 

- Using image item by upload it to stylesheets and helper tag

- Upload app to Heroku (just on Windows)

- Up video, making video start/autoplay/muted when the page is loaded 

- Product#Show using Carousel got problem with Flickity error ,found another way (Using take method and ruby params to take JS code work normally)

- Zoom page but all the item not moving (CSS : flex method ,@Media ,margin - padding :auto ,max-height(width) )

- Add CSS box-shadow ,opacity ,transform: translateY(-5px) to Product#index 

***` What I need to practice more :

- Learn very clearly about Associations (Rails)

- Choose images from Product and mark them with many types to make it appear in the Homepage (Rails)

- Sort item (Rails)

- Edit navbar ,product item when zoom

- Online payment

- Choose type of color of product when add it to cart
